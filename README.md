Project Title: Digit Classifier: Deep Learning with MNIST
Project Overview-
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The objective is to demonstrate the capability of neural networks in recognizing patterns and digits from image data.

Features-
Data Preprocessing: The MNIST dataset images are preprocessed to fit the model's input requirements.
Model Building: An ANN model with multiple layers is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras.
Training: The model is trained with a specified number of epochs to optimize accuracy.
Evaluation: Performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy metrics on a test set.

Technologies Used- Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Model Performance-
The final model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.5% on the test dataset, which highlights the model's effectiveness in digit recognition tasks.
